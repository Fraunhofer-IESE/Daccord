# Architecture drivers

At least three relevant stakeholders can be named in two-sided digital data platforms: the data providers, the data consumers, and the platform operators. Data providers are frequently associated with end users: they own data about themselves, and their data is shared through the platform to the data consumers. Data consumers, in turn, are related to companies interested in the data. Considering data providers' perspective, their concerns include self-determination and information about data usage. Data consumers, on the other hand, have data usage needs. Finally, one important quality of a DPC for the platform operators is its adaptability, meaning that the DPC has the quality of being adaptable to work with heterogeneous platforms.

This section presents the _key functional requirements (KFR) and the _quality requirements_ (QR) of the DPC. The former refers to what functions the system performs; the latter refers to how well the system works. To document the quality requirement, we used _architecture scenarios_, where the driver is described in terms of a concrete scenario with a well-defined environment, a stimulus, a response, and quantifications of the previous ones. Concerning the key functional requirements, we use a formal requirements template.
