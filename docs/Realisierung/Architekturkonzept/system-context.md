# System context and domain model

## System context

While the platform, at its core, is responsible for brokering data assets from providers to consumers, the DPC is a software component integrated into the platform to enable the participants to send data-related messages to each other. We refer to these messages generically as _notifications_. If a participant wants to request something from another participant, or inform another participant about something, the participant sends a _notification_.

Three entities interact with the DSC: the platform core, the data provider, and the data consumer (see figure below). Note that the platform core also gets information about grants from the DPC.

There are different types of notifications sent from participant to participant. For example:

- the data provider can _request data access_ (notification of type "data access request") from the data consumer;
- the data consumer can _request data modification_ (type: "data modification request") from the platform core;
- the data consumer can _report a data-leak incident_ (type: "incident report") to data providers;

The diagram below features the role "ecosystem participant" as a generalization for each participant. Furthermore, this diagram illustrates functions specific to each participant, reflecting different notification types.

The next diagram puts these elements into a larger context. Now, we see the platform core and the DPC as part of a _Data Intermediation Platform_, which is operated by a _platform provider_. The diagram also makes explicit the existence of a _third-party data consumer_, an organization that operates a _data consumer system_ (used by a user).

This diagram includes two platform core functions: _provide data asset_ and _get data asset_. These functions implement the asset brokering aspect of the data intermediation platform. **It is worth noting that these functions do not belong to the scope of the DPC.**
